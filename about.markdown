![Beatrice](https://placekitten.com/g/200/300)

This is me when I was a little girl. My momma always said that quadripeds make the best daughters. So of course, I obliged. Also, this is my son's idea of a mother's day present. Please. Ain't nobody got time for this.

I'm currently getting certified in getting my certification in brain and nutrition and when I'm done I will be 100% certified. This means I will be more able to help you with your health, instead of helping you less. This is good news. For you mostly, not for me. My stomach always hurts. Well not always, but most days, becasue I love food so much and I yoyo diet every time I read a new science article that claims to have found the key to I don't even know what the fuck anymore...
