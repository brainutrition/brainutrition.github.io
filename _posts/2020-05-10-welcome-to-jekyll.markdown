In this post we're going to talk about mother's day health. Why? Because it's important AF! That's street talk for "important as fuck".

So now you know.

The next topic we're going to skip over is how the brain works. Basically, your brain is the root of all your problems. Fix your your brain and fix what's bothering you is what I always say.

The next topic is health and health is important because without it you're going to be very sick. This is especially important now due to COVID-19, so stay healthy. Unless you can't becasue you're sick, in which case, buh-bye! It was nice knowing you, or not knowing you. Whatever.

And the last topic I'd like to deeply skim over is nutrition and what role it has on your energy levels. So basically nutrition is fuel. From the latin word "nihil" which means nothing and the other latin word "magna" which means important, we can make a logical deduction that nutrition is not nothing important.

You follow?

If not it's ok. You're probably malnourished or anemic or both and going to die soon. Unless I step in and tell you what to eat to save your sorry life, which maybe isn't worth saving becasue you're psychopath who kills cats for fun.
